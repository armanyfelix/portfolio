            Hi! I{'â€™'}m Luis, a full stack software developer with a strong background in development with
            Node.js and React. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Baja California
            by but I decided to leave it to focus on my career as a programmer on my own.

            around with tech, my first lenguage was C++, I love challenges and I am always looking for ways to
            improve my skills, make my stack better and create solutions to make the web even better.
