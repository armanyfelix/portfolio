            Hi! I{'â€™'}m Luis, a full stack software developer with a strong background in development with
            Node.js and React. I studied Mechatronics Engineering at Universidad Nacional de Baja California
            by but I decided to leave it to focus on my career as a programmer on my own.

          <p>
            Since I was 15 years old I{"'"}ve been creating basic HTML websites, android apps and just playing
            around with tech, I like challenges and I am always looking for ways to improve my skills, make my
            stack better and create solutions to make the web even better.
          </p>
